Hi there! I am a PhD student in the [Department of Philosophy](https://philosophy.utoronto.ca/), and a collaborative program student in [Mark S. Bonham Centre for Sexual Diversity Studies](https://sds.utoronto.ca/), both at the University of Toronto.

I am interested in philosophical inquiries into trauma, care, and life and death, drawing on the resources of continental philosophy (especially Heidegger and contemporary French phenomenology), East Asian literature and philosophy (with a focus on Watsuji Tetsurō and Miyazawa Kenji), and trans and queer philosophy.

Outside of philosophy, I am also a member of [One Among Us](https://oneamongus.ca), a “warm, strong and resilient community for East-Asian and East-Asian Canadian transgender and gender-diverse people.” I use the name [Beiyan Shu](https://sauri.ca) for community activities and writings.
